## Why

Kaku (書く, かく) means “to write” in Japanese. It is based on WezTerm, with fonts, themes, shell integration, and Mac shortcuts already configured. Lua settings remain available when you want to customize it.

Part of a trilogy: [Kaku](https://github.com/tw93/Kaku) (書く) writes code, [Waza](https://github.com/tw93/Waza) (技) drills habits, [Kami](https://github.com/tw93/Kami) (紙) ships documents. Think of them as a family: Kaku is the dad, Waza the big sister, Kami the little sister.

## Quick Start

Download the [Kaku DMG](https://github.com/tw93/Kaku/releases/latest), open it, and drag Kaku into Applications. Or install with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install tw93/tap/kakuku
```

Open Kaku to set up shell integration. Missing optional tools can be installed through `kaku init`. Check your installed version with `kaku --version`.

## Features

- **Ready to use**: JetBrains Mono, automatic dark and light themes, copy on select, and familiar Mac shortcuts.
- **Tabs and panes**: Split your workspace, find a pane with Tab Navigator, and restore windows, panes, and working directories when you reopen Kaku.
- **Right-click menu**: Paste, search, open AI chat, and split or close the clicked pane without remembering shortcuts.
- **Clickable links**: `Cmd + Click` opens URLs and file paths; URLs automatically wrapped by the terminal keep their full address.
- **AI-friendly**: Use your coding tools alongside an optional assistant for command suggestions and chat. Configure your own AI service with `kaku ai`.
- **Shell tools**: Built-in zsh completion, syntax highlighting, and directory jumping, with shortcuts for optional Lazygit and Yazi installations.
- **Lua configuration**: Customize fonts, themes, shortcuts, and terminal behavior using WezTerm's Lua configuration system.

## Kaku AI

Configure your own AI service with `kaku ai` to use the built-in assistant. Kaku does not provide or relay the AI service.

- **Command suggestions**: When a command fails, the configured assistant can suggest a fix. Press `Cmd + Shift + E` to paste it at the prompt for review.
- **Natural language to command**: Type `# <description>` at the prompt and press Enter. The assistant places the generated command at the prompt for you to review and run.
- **Chat**: Press `Cmd + L` to discuss terminal output or work with project files and tools. Use `kaku chat` from another shell to access the same conversation store.
- **AI Tools Config**: Manage settings for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, Kimi Code, and more.

For authentication, models, API Mode, and tool settings, see the [AI assistant docs](docs/features.md).

## FAQ

**Is there a Windows or Linux version?** Not currently. Kaku is macOS-only for now.

**Can I use transparent windows?** Yes, set `config.window_background_opacity` in `~/.config/kaku/kaku.lua`.

**The `kaku` command is missing.** Run `/Applications/Kaku.app/Contents/MacOS/kaku init --update-only && exec zsh -l`, then `kaku doctor`.

## Background

I heavily rely on the CLI for both work and personal projects. Tools I've built, like [Mole](https://github.com/tw93/mole) and [Pake](https://github.com/tw93/pake), reflect this.

I used Alacritty for years and learned to value speed and simplicity. As my workflow shifted toward AI-assisted coding, I wanted stronger tab and pane ergonomics. I also explored Kitty, Ghostty, Warp, and iTerm2. Each is strong in different areas, but I still wanted a setup that matched my own balance of performance, defaults, and control.

WezTerm is robust and highly hackable, and I am grateful for its engine and ecosystem. So I built Kaku to be that environment: fast, polished, and ready to work.
